This tool is for Unity, please make sure you keep it within an "Editor" folder for your own sanity while using Unity Editor. 

In order to use it, batch select a group of meshes in your project UI and right click to go to "Mesh Processing Wizard" in the context menu. It will then pop the pictured window above. The plugin has three 'modes.' The first mode, if you have neither checkbox selected, will copy each respective mesh from the selected meshes in the tool's array and move them to the targeted folder with their placeholder materials deleted or replaced with a material referenced in the tool. The second mode, when "Modify Original Mode" is selected, moves the original mesh to the target folder and deletes the original material or replaces it. The third mode is, "Delete Original," which deletes the original mesh and saves off a copy at the target folder with original materials removed or substituted with your referenced material. 

Make something great with it! Best of luck! 

Current version is 1.00. 

Planned additions: 

replacing all references to the mesh you moved/edited/copied in engine.
